          Greetings! My name is Nichole Jhoy Esca√±o. I am an aspiring UI/UX Designer and a third-year BS Information Technology student at Saint Louis University, Baguio City. 
          I love designing websites that are both visually appealing and user-friendly. My goal is to create functional and beautiful websites that effectively convey your message.

         When I'm not coding or designing, I love exploring new technologies, reading books, and enjoying the outdoors. I also watch TV series and movies and listen to music leisurely.
